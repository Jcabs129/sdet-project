I want to use Playwright MCP server to open Swag labs login page (https://www.saucedemo.com/) 
Make sure to handle all the browser interaction via MCP server. Do not simulate the tests statically 
or bypass the MCP server. all interactions must be via MCP.

On Swag labs lets execute below the scenarios listed below.


Scenario 1 - Negative Login Scenarios (via MCP-Playwright server):

navigate to login page https://www.saucedemo.com/
enter username "locked_out_user" and password "secret_sauce"
verify that the error message is visible to the user
verify that the user is still on the login page
verify that the error message contains the text "Epic sadface: Sorry"


ensure that when code gen is generated via MCP server, it follows the design pattern i have strutured 
in my `sdet-project/e2e-tests-playwright` directory and the code generated is written in typescipt.


```
e2e-tests-playwright/
  ├── fixtures/      # Shared test data, setup, and teardown logic
  │     └── pom/     # Page Object Model related fixtures and options
  ├── pages/         # Page Object Model classes for each app page
  └── tests/         # Test files and test suites
```

After both tests are executed, close the browser. 
Make sure to handle all the browser interaction via MCP server.
